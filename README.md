Hello there! I'm Yukesh Raghavan, a passionate and dedicated Computer Engineering graduate student at Stony Brook University, with a strong background in software development and a keen interest in cutting-edge technologies. Currently pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Engineering, my journey has been shaped by a combination of rigorous academic training and hands-on experience in the realm of computer science.

**Educational Background**
I am currently enrolled in the Master of Science in Computer Engineering program at Stony Brook University, where I've delved deep into subjects such as Data Structures and Algorithms, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Distributed Systems. My academic journey began at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, where I earned my Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Engineering. 

**Technical Proficiency**
My technical toolkit includes a range of programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C, and JavaScript. I am well-versed in various technologies and frameworks, including NodeJS, React, Angular, TensorFlow, and Django. I have hands-on experience with developer tools like Git, GitHub, VS Code, and various project management tools like JIRA. My expertise also extends to database technologies such as MySQL and MongoDB.

**Professional Experience**
During my tenure as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Stony Brook University, I mentored students in programming principles, data structures, and algorithms. I conducted thorough code reviews, enhancing code quality and reducing debugging efforts. Additionally, I contributed significantly as a Software Engineer Intern at Learnovate E-commerce, where I played a pivotal role in developing a successful E-Commerce web application using React and Node.js.

**Noteworthy Projects**
I have been involved in diverse projects, including the development of a React-based Job Search Application and implementing Data Mining techniques for Market Basket Analysis in a retail context. I have also created a Hotel Management System application, integrating Java servlets and JSP for streamlined functionality.

**Achievements and Extra-Curricular Activities**
Apart from academics, I have excelled in extracurricular activities and achieved recognition for my efforts. I ranked in the top 10 among 220 students in the Computer Engineering Branch at SRM University. At Stony Brook University, I served as the Graduate Facility Manager of the Student Activities Center, successfully organizing over 250 college events.

I am driven by a curiosity to explore innovative solutions, a commitment to excellence, and a passion for continuous learning.
